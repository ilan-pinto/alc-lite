# ðŸš€ Performance: Integrate uvloop for 2-4x async speedup

## Overview
Replace standard asyncio event loop with uvloop to achieve 2-4x performance improvements in async operations, critical for high-frequency options arbitrage execution.

## Current Performance Pain Points
- Complex parallel execution in `parallel_executor.py` (850+ lines of async logic)
- Multiple concurrent operations: order placement, fill monitoring, rollback management
- Real-time trading requires microsecond-level latency optimizations
- Heavy async usage with ib_async library for IB connectivity

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Integration
- [ ] Add `uvloop>=0.19.0` to requirements.txt
- [ ] Modify `alchimest.py` to auto-detect and use uvloop:
```python
import asyncio
try:
    import uvloop
    asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(uvloop.EventLoopPolicy())
    print("âœ“ Using uvloop for enhanced async performance")
except ImportError:
    print("â„¹ Using standard asyncio (install uvloop for better performance)")
```
- [ ] Update async entry points in:
  - `modules/Arbitrage/Strategy.py`
  - `modules/Arbitrage/sfr/parallel_executor.py`
  - `commands/option.py`
- [ ] Test compatibility with ib_async library
- [ ] Verify all existing async patterns work with uvloop

### Phase 2: Performance Validation
- [ ] Create `benchmarks/async_performance.py` comparing asyncio vs uvloop
- [ ] Measure improvements in:
  - Parallel order execution speed (target: <100ms placement)
  - Market data processing throughput
  - Options chain qualification batching
  - Overall scan cycle time
- [ ] Document performance gains with before/after metrics

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- [ ] Add uvloop installation to CLAUDE.md setup documentation
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions CI to test with both asyncio and uvloop
- [ ] Add graceful fallback if uvloop unavailable
- [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard metrics

## Expected Performance Benefits
- **2-4x faster async operations** (proven in production systems)
- **Reduced order placement latency** (critical for arbitrage capture)
- **Better handling of concurrent market data streams**
- **Lower CPU usage** during high-frequency scanning
- **Improved fill monitoring responsiveness**

## Success Metrics
- [ ] 50% reduction in async operation overhead
- [ ] Sub-100ms order placement timing (current: varies)
- [ ] Successful execution of all existing tests with uvloop
- [ ] No regression in parallel executor performance
- [ ] Improved throughput in daily data collection

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¢ Low
- Drop-in replacement for asyncio
- Extensive production usage (FastAPI, Sanic)
- Fallback mechanism maintains compatibility
- No code changes required for most async patterns

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests:** All existing async tests must pass
2. **Integration Tests:** Full parallel execution workflow
3. **Performance Tests:** Before/after benchmarks
4. **Compatibility Tests:** ib_async library integration
5. **Load Tests:** High-frequency scanning scenarios
