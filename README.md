# Alchimist-Lite (alc-lite)

**Alchimist-Lite** is a powerful command-line tool designed for traders and financial analysts to scan for and analyze arbitrage opportunities in the options market. It currently supports Synthetic-Free-Risk (SFR) and Synthetic (non-risk-free) strategies.

The project is built with a focus on modularity and extensibility, allowing for the easy addition of new arbitrage strategies. It leverages `ib-async` for interacting with Interactive Brokers and `rich` for beautiful and informative console output.

## üöÄ Features

- **Arbitrage Strategy Scanning**: Scan for SFR and Synthetic arbitrage opportunities.
- **Interactive Brokers Integration**: Connects to IBKR for real-time market data.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new strategies by inheriting from the `ArbitrageClass`.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple and intuitive CLI for running scans.
- **CI/CD Automation**: Automated versioning, testing, and releases powered by GitHub Actions.
