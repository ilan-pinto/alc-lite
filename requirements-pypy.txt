# Notes for PyPy compatibility:
# 1. numpy operations may be slower than CPython for small arrays
# 2. C extensions that don't support PyPy are excluded
# 3. Some packages may need alternative implementations
# 4. Memory usage patterns differ - PyPy generally uses more RAM initially
#    but is more efficient for long-running processes
